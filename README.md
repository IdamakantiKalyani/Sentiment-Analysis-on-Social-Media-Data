# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media


   


## Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a process of extracting emotions or sentiments from a raw text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics. People express their opinions and feelings on various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Social Media Sentiment Analysis can help organizations or marketers to understand how people perceive or feel about their brand, products, services, etc.


## Why is Sentiment Analysis Important
 
1) Understanding Customer Feedback

2) Reputation Management 

3) Political Analysis 

4) Crisis Management

5) Marketing Research 
## How To Do ?
--> To analyze Twitter sentiment analysis Dataset using machine learning algorithms, the sentiment of tweets provided from the dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

--> The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores.

--> For data preprocessing, we will be using Natural Language Processingâ€™s (NLP) NLTK library.

## Steps Involved
The various steps involved in the project are:

Step1 : Import Necessary Dependencies

Step2 : Read and Load the Dataset

Step3 :Exploratory Data Analysis

Step4 : Data Visualization of Target Variables

Step5 : Data Preprocessing

Step6 : Splitting our data into Train and Test sets.

Step7 : Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Step8 : Function for Model Evaluation

Step9 : Model Building

Step10 : Model Evaluation
